// Define channel methods between Flutter and native sides, the basic format is:
//
// method_name[#comment]\n
//
// You're not supposed to alter the platform-specific method list file directly
// because this may raise inconsistent problems. Once a new method is created,
// please add to this file and run 'methods_gen.sh' to update all relative files
